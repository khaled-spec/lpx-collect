Frontend Task To-Do List:
Remove "New Payments Method" and "New Address" Options

Remove the options that allow users to add new payment methods and new address. These features are not required at this stage.
Update the UI to reflect these changes.
Handle Product Specifications and Editing

Currently, we are not passing the product specifications and edit functionality, but it is still being displayed on the frontend.
Modify the frontend to hide these specifications or add functionality to pass these details dynamically.
Ensure that new product posting incorporates specification handling, and update the UI accordingly.
Hide "Add User" Button

The "Add User" button is not functional.
You need to make the button functional or hide it completely from the UI until its functionality is implemented.
Remove "Select Filter Option"

The "Select Filter Option" should be hidden from the UI as it is not needed.
Show Dummy Data for Product Details

Since the backend is not passing product details dynamically yet, populate the UI with some dummy product data so we can visualize how the frontend will look with real data.
Analytics Section

Implement a basic analytics display on the frontend to show dummy analytics data (e.g., sales data, product views, etc.).
This is for visual representation until the backend functionality is available.
Update Wishlist and Cart Lists

Add some items to the wishlist and cart list to showcase these features on the frontend.
Ensure the cart and wishlist UI components are styled and working properly with dummy data.
Simplify User Profile

Update the user profile UI to only show "Name" instead of "First Name" and "Last Name" separately.
This will improve the consistency of the profile details shown.
